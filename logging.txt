Log4j2 API has more advantages
it will provide us the logging capabilities

It will be helps us to implement logging in our java applications
it has improved performance

logs will be saved in logfiles so that we can refer them later on

spring boot comes inbuilt with log4j
we will be present in springboot-starter dependency

private static final Logger LOG = LogManager.getLogger(Application.class.getCanonicalName());

we can configure our loggers using XML,json,Yaml 
most popular xml
in XML file
name should be log4j2.xml
root level ="error" this will be the default level for all the packages where we use logger
Appenders will specify where to append the logs

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23296477/how-to-have-spring-boot-use-a-log4j-xml-configuration-file
use second answer given
to prevent spring boot by using logback which has higher predency and to make spring boot use log4j

 <Logger name="com.example.Log4j.Log4jdemo.Controller" level="error" additivity="false">
            <AppenderRef ref="Console"/>
 </Logger>

 name is the name of the package for which  we want to specific the level 

 additivity = false : only custom logger message according to the level will be printed
 additivity = true: both in root and in custom logger message according to the level will be printed

    to append the logs to file 

    filename : to specify the name of first file to store logs
    filePattern : if the size of the first file excedds size=500 kb, new log files will be created by this name
    properties : this tag is used give alias names ex: it will replace all "${filename}" by ./logs according to example below

     <Properties>
        <Property name="filename">./logs</Property>
    </Properties>
  <RollingFile name="file_logs" filename="${filename}/file_logs.log"
                     filePattern = "${filename}/file_logs.log" append="true">
            <PatternLayout pattern="[%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
            <Policies>
                <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="500 KB"/>
            </Policies>
    </RollingFile>
