Spring framework is a Java development framework which is used to create web applications and enterprise applications.

Advantages of Spring framework:

dependency injection
database transaction management
integration with other java frameworks
web MVC framework for building web apps


Spring boot was built on spring framework
Spring boot is an extension of Spring framework
The main goal of Spring Boot is to quickly create production ready Spring-based applications without requiring developers to write the same boilerplate configuration again and again

Spring boot key features:

Spring boot starters
Spring boot autoConfiguration
Externalized Configuration
Spring Boot acutators
easy to use embedded servlet container support

Spring based applications have a lot of Configuration.
when we use spring MVC, we need to configure
	Component scan, Dispatcher Servlet, View resolver, Web jars(for delivering static content) among other things

when we use Hibernate/JPA, we would need to configure a 
	data source, entity manager factory/session factory, transaction manager

when we use cache
	cache configuration

when we use Message queue
	Message queue Configuration

when we use NOSQL database
	Nosql database configuration


Spring Boot takes care of all these configuration


spring-boot-started-web includes all commonly used libraries to develop web app



Spring Boot AutoConfiguration attempts to automatically configure your spring application based on the jar dependencies that you have added.

Externalized Configuration helps in deploying your spring applications in different environments.

Different ways to create spring Boot Project:
	using spring initializer
	using spring starter project in STS(Eclipse)
	Spring Boot CLI: the spring boot cli is a command line tool that you can use if you want to quickly develop a spring application.


spring initializer : start.spring.io

Spring boot tool in eclipse

Spring boot cli:


if want to deploy our application in other environment select packaging as war

spring-boot-starter-web used to create:
	spring web application
	spring REST API application

to check Auto Configuration in properties write (logging.level.org.springframework.web=debug)

@RestController : it will make class as a restfull and allows that class to serve rest end points
@GetMapping : rest end points


import java.utils.List
for auto import Shift+Ctrl+O


Controller and db files should be  inside src.main.java.application_name

Service layer is mainly responsible for business logic


Dependency injections

to automatically instantiate

@Service : for class which has to be automatically instantitated
@Autowired : for method which needs auto instantiate
