Spring security

Full support for form-based authentication
create extension of webSecurityConfigureAdapter
use @EnableWebSecurity(removes all basic security configuration)
Backed with datastore or in-memory(demo only)
Full support for OAuth2, Server, and client
Default implementation out of the box, using @EnableOAuth2Client annotation

Simple authorization server can be created with the annotation @EnableAuthorization Server, and it can be customized

ResourceServer is just as simple: @EnableResourceServer

Not on Hashing
Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted
SHA-1 should be considered owned
Bcrypt is industry standard and should be used for form-based authentication

Implementation

in pom.xml
add dependency
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
	
</dependency>
